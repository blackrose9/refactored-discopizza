#### By blackrose9

## Description
This is a Pizza ordering app. You can pick the size of your pizza, toppings and type of crust.
Place your order and have it either delivered to you or you can pick it up from the store.

## To-Do
* Fix known bugs using ES6 features to simplify how the functionality is achieved.
* Make order items into individual cards. Nice and pretty looking.
* Add delete function so that an item can be removed from the order
* Add payment option.

## Known Bugs
* Doesn't stop you from choosing delivery or pickup even when there is no item in order.
* And extra long order will extend the page. To-Do make this extension somehow aesthetically pleasing.
* The Pizza might be a little bit tempting
